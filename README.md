# Vagrant setup for trying out the quadlet-demo by ygalblum

This setup prepares on CentOS9 Stream VM and then runs the Ansible playbook from ygalblum's [quadlet-demo](https://github.com/ygalblum/quadlet-demo) repository.

This will install Podman on the VM and then configure things using Quadlet, so in the end there is a Wordpress+MySQL setup with envoy.
